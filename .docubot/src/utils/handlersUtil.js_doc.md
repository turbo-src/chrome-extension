This JavaScript file contributes to handling the utility functions of a Google Chrome extension related to handling HTML content for buttons and path content. 

Here are the main elements:

1. **commonUtil and authContributor** are objects imported from different modules. The commonUtil object is imported from the commonUtil.js file and it houses shared utility functions. The authContributor object is imported from the authorizedContributor file, which likely houses the process to authorize a contributor for the extension.

2. **createButtonHtml:** This function is deprecated (no longer recommended for use, usually due to improvements or changes).

3. **handlersUtil:** This is the primary object exported by this file and contains two functions:

   - **onPathContentFetchedForBtns:** Inserts a button group in the DOM at specified location after its content has been fetched.
            
   - **onPathContentFetched:** Fetches the content of the path, updates the DOM and also creates buttons for voting "yes" or "no" using the base64-encoded svg images provided.

This file is part of the source code for a Google Chrome extension. It manipulates the DOM according to the fetched content and injects button HTML with base64-encoded SVGs. The file exports the handlersUtil object at the end, which can be used by other modules.
