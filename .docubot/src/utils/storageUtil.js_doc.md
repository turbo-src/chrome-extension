**File Documentation:** `/app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/utils/storageUtil.js`

This JavaScript file is part of a Chrome extension application, and it's specifically stored in the `utils` directory. It likely serves utility functions for the app, particularly for storage utilities. Defined within the file is `storageUtil` object with `set` and `get` methods.

**API:**
- `set(key, value)`: This method accepts a key-value pair and stores it within the `storageUtil` object. The key is the identifier that will be used to retrieve the value later on.
- `get(key)`: This method accepts a key and returns the corresponding value from the `storageutil` object. If the key doesn't exist, it returns `undefined`.

This module could be an abstraction over the actual Storage API used by the Chrome extension, possibly to simplify the code elsewhere in the application where storage-related operations are needed. The exported `storageUtil` object suggests that these methods can be imported and used across various other files in the application.
