**File:** /app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/utils/authUtil.js

This file is an utility module for authentication purpose in the chrome extension. It exports one method, `getAuthContributor()` which is an asynchronous function. 

**Functions:**

  - `getAuthContributor()` It's an asynchronous function that reads file `mock_contributor` from the system and returns the data. In case of any error during the file reading process, it logs the error message with 'Failed to read file'.

The code also contains some commented-out code (presumably used during testing), which demonstrates how to use the `getAuthContributor` function by awaiting its result and logging the output.

Please note, for this utility to work properly ensure that the `mock_contributor` file should be present in the correct location as defined in the function.

**Dependencies:**
 - `fs` from Node's File System module: It's being used with its 'promises' property for reading file asynchronously.
