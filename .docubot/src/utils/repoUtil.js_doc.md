The file /app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/utils/repoUtil.js is a JavaScript utility script responsible for managing the file system storage in a Chrome extension. It uses the Web File API to request access to the file system storage. 

Key points of the script:

1. Adds support for both standard and Webkit specific file system API.
2. Defines the type of file system storage (PERSISTENT) to be used and its size (10MB).
3. Uses `window.storageInfo.requestQuota` method to request the specified amount of space in the file system.
4. If the quota is granted, it uses `window.requestFileSystem` to create a `DOMFileSystem` instance.
5. Handles any errors that occur during these processes with `errorHandler` callback.
