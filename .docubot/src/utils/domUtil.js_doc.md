This file, `domUtil.js`, contains utility functions for manipulating Document Object Model (DOM) elements, interacting with an API, and handling some other common tasks related to a web-based JavaScript application.

Key Functions:

- `getVote()`: Sends a POST request with a `graphql` query to vote on the localhost.
- `fetchDataAndCreateDOMElements()`: Fetches data and creates DOM elements for Copy and Download button, and File Size and Download Link.
- `selectText()`: Copies a block of text found in a `tbody` HTML tag.
- `hasClass()`, `hasId()`, `getId()`: Functions to check and get the class and id of any DOM element.
- `appendRepoSizeElement()`: Removes previous instances of element with class '.eg-repo-size' and creates a new HTML element containing the repository size converted to a human-readable format.
- `addRepoData()`: Fetches GitHub repository data. If URL corresponding to repository data already exists in local storage, it directly creates DOM elements (Copy and Download button, and File Size and Download Link). Otherwise, it makes an API call to get repository content and updates local storage with repository size and default branch details. Once data is fetched, it calls functions to create relevant DOM elements.
- `addCopyAndDownloadButton()`, `addFileSizeAndDownloadLink()`: These functions add buttons and link related to copying and downloading content from a repository to the HTML DOM based on URL validations and API call to fetch repository content.

The file also exports a `domUtil` object containing the methods defined in the file.

Relevant Libraries:

- `clipboard` enables clipboard actions such as copy and paste.
- `https` manages HTTPS connections.
- Other library imports include `apiUtil`, `commonUtil`, `handlersUtil` and `storageUtil`. These are likely to include various utility methods for API interactions, general purpose functions, event handlers, and storage management respectively.
