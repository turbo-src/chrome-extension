The file `/app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/utils/handlersUtil2.js` is part of a JavaScript module for a Chrome extension.

Notably, the module exports a utility object `handlersUtil` with two main methods: `onPathContentFetchedForBtns` and `onPathContentFetched`.
- `onPathContentFetchedForBtns` method: This function does not seem to hold any significant operations beyond a currently empty string template. It appears it may be a placeholder for further development.
- `onPathContentFetched` method: This function appears to generate and insert "Yes" and "No" voting buttons into the HTML interface of GitHub issues. It seems to be capable of doing this only for pages corresponding to a repository’s list of pull requests. The voting buttons are set to use a provided contributor ID (presumably from a web wallet extension) and specific issue ID to help structure the voting system.

There’s also a helper function `createButtonHtml` for generating the HTML code for the voting buttons. The module imports utility functions from `'./commonUtil'` and information about authorized contributors from `'../authorizedContributor'`.

This utility can be potentially useful for projects seeking to integrate a voting system on issues or pull requests in GitHub using a Chrome extension. It appears to be a part of a larger system, possibly for a decentralized app or a blockchain project, considering the possible connections to web wallets and authorized contributors.
