This Javascript file `commonUtil.js` is located under the utils file-specific path `/app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/utils`. It features a variety of utility functions that could be used in a Chrome Extension, including:

1. `getVote`: Makes a POST request to a localhost GraphQL server and logs the received data to the console.

2. `getContentPath`: Extracts the content path from the current window's URL.

3. `getUsernameWithReponameFromGithubURL`: Extracts the username and repository name from the current GitHub page URL.

4. `sortOn`: Allows sorting of an array of objects based on a key.

5. `sortFileStructureAsOnSite`: Arranges a collection of items mimicking the order of files and directories seen on a webpage. 

6. `convertSizeToHumanReadableFormat`: Converts file sizes into easily readable formats (e.g., KB, MB, GB, etc.). 

7. `getFileSizeAndUnit`: Mechanism has been set to always return a fixed size (10) and unit (votes). Presumably, it was initially for providing file sizes in human readable format.

8. `removePrevInstancesOf`: Removes all HTML elements in the document that match a given selector.

9. `isObjEqual`: Checks if two given objects are identical. Utilizes a helper function `isObject` to check if a supplied object is indeed an object.

Note: The `getObject`, `getBranch` and previous definition of the `getContentPath` function are commented out and not in use.
