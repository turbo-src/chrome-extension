Title: deferredUtil.js

This `/app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/utils/deferredUtil.js` file is part of the chrome-extension utility of the application housed in the `app/filebot-store-000` directory. 

This specific JavaScript module deals with the generation and management of Promise objects primarily using the `Deferred` class. Essentially, it creates a 'Deferred' object which includes a Promise and its associated resolve and reject methods, providing a method to handle asynchronous operations.

Summary of Components:

- **Deferred class**: Creates a new Promise object, providing both its resolution and rejection procedures as its own properties. This functionality is useful for complex asynchronous tasks, allowing the promise to be resolved or rejected at any time from outside the constructor's executor function.

- **module.exports**: Exports the Deferred class to be imported or required in a different module. The `module.exports = Deferred;` allows this module to be reused elsewhere in the application where promise deferral is required.

Overall, this module provides a utility for managing asynchronous operations and handling promise resolutions and rejections within the chrome extension feature of this app.
