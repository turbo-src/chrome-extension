The file "messageListenerUtil.js" is a utility module in the Google Chrome Extension located at `/app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/utils/`. It is used for listening to the specific messages passed within the extension. 

The main features of this file are the functions `onMessage` and `addListeners`. 

1. `onMessage()` - This function adds an event listener to the Chrome runtime to listen to messages being passed. If a received message is of type `PAGE_RENDERED`, the `addRepoData` function from the `domUtil` module is invoked.
   
2. `addListeners()` - This function simply calls the `onMessage` function, therefore starting the listener.

This file has dependencies on the following modules:  
a. `domUtil` - for adding repository data to the DOM.  
b. `MessageType` - for comparing sent message types.

This utility is mainly concerned with updating the DOM when a `PAGE_RENDERED` message is received, indicating a fresh render of a page has occurred. When this happens, additional repository data is added to the new page render by calling `domUtil.addRepoData()`.
