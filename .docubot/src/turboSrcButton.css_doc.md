File: /app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/turboSrcButton.css

Summary:

This CSS file provides the style definitions for elements within the Chrome extension of the app/filebot-store-000. It includes two CSS classes - .textColor and .bgColor.

1. .textColor: This class is used to change the color of the text to white. Any text element associated with this class will have a white color.

2. .bgColor: This class is used to change the background color of an element to purple. Any element associated with this class will have a purple background. 

This simple style sheet seems to be leveraged to bring some customization to the UI elements, particularly those related to text and background colors, within the Chrome extension of the application.
