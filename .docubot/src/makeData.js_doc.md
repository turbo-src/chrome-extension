This JavaScript file exports a function named `makeData` which creates and returns an array, where each element is an object. These objects represent people, each having 6 different properties: firstName, lastName, age, visits, progress, and status.

Functions:

1. `range(len)`: This function takes an integer `len` as input and returns an array with `len` elements, from 0 to `len - 1`.

2. `newPerson()`: This function creates and returns a new person object. The properties of the object are generated randomly using the external library 'namor' and `Math.random()`. The 'status' property has a 33.3% chance of being 'single', 33.3% chance of being 'complicated', and a 33.4% chance of being in 'relationship'.

3. `makeData(...lens)`: This function is the default exported function. It uses the rest parameter syntax (`...lens`) to take any number of arguments, and creates a hierarchical data structure. It calls the helper function `makeDataLevel(depth)` recursively to produce an array of 'person' objects for each level of depth. The length of the array for each level of depth is specified by the `lens` argument.

4. `makeDataLevel(depth = 0)`: This is a helper function used within `makeData(...lens)`. It generates an array of 'person' objects of length `lens[depth]`. Furthermore, if there is another level (determined by `lens[depth + 1]`), it adds a 'subRows' property to each person object and assigns it the data for the next depth level generated recursively.

Note: The 'namor' package is used for generating random names for the 'firstName' and 'lastName' properties of the person objects. 'namor.generate({ words: 1, numbers: 0 })' generates a single word with no numbers. The 'status' property indicates the relationship status of the person.
