File: VoteButtonGroup.js

This JavaScript file defines a functional React component named `VoteButtonGroup`, which is a styled group of two `VoteButton` components. The structure of the file includes an import section, CSS-in-JS definitions, and the final rendering of the component.

The `VoteButtonGroup` function component receives a multitude of properties that are further passed to the `VoteButton` components as props. These include settings for whether the button is disabled, which side (yes/no) is currently chosen, handler functions for interactions such as clicking and changing the vote side, user information, and data about the issue and repository on GitHub.

This styled `BtnGroupVote` is flexbox-based, effectively creating a centered, aligned row of `VoteButton` instances. This component also includes a CSS pseudo-element to ensure clear separation between different components in the app, excluding the last child.

The `VoteButtonGroup` contains two instances of `VoteButton`, one representing a 'yes' vote and the other representing a 'no' vote. These components are responsible for user interaction with voting functionality in the application.

Overall, `VoteButtonGroup.js` is a key component in managing and displaying the user's voting options and responses in a clear, styled manner.
