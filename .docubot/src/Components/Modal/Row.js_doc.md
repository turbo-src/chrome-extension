"Row.js" is a JavaScript file located in the "Modal" directory of the source code for the Chrome extension part of the "filebot-store-000" application. 

Key functions:
1. `getDurationSince(timestamp)`: Calculates the time difference between the current time and the passed timestamp. Returns this difference in seconds, minutes, hours, or days.

2. `makeAllCaps(str)`: Converts a string to uppercase.

3. `addCommas(num)`: Adds commas to a number for readability purposes (i.e., to create a thousand separators).

The `Row` component:
This is a styled component that shows voting details. It consists of a `VoteRow` containing several 'Text' fields which include an identification number (id), voting power (votepower), vote side (yes/no - transformed with `makeAllCaps` function), and the time since the vote was placed (utilizing `getDurationSince` function).

Styling:
Various styled components, such as `VoteRow`, `Unit`, `Text`, and `SideText`, are created using `styled-components` to apply CSS in JS. They transform generic HTML tags into unique styled components with attached CSS. 

All these styled-components help in constructing modular and reusable components for the application layout. 

The `row()` function:
This is the main exported function from this file. It takes in `props` as an argument, uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from React to handle state and side effects within the function/component respectively, and then returns the `Row` component filled with the appropriate data provided via `props`. 

The state `ticker` is utilized to re-render this component every second, which also updates the 'age' of the vote.
