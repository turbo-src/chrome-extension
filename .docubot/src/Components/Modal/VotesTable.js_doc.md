This JavaScript file defines a component, `VotesTable`, for a voting user interface for the Google Chrome extension of the 'FileBot' application. The file has dependencies on the React library, Styled Components, and another component file named `Row.js`.

Components Defined:
1. `VotesTable` - This is the main export of this file. It is a functional React component. It uses the `allVotes` object from incoming props to generate a table with rows of voting data. The voting data includes 'Contributor ID', 'Vote Power', 'Side' and 'Age'. It utilizes the `Row` component for rendering views for each set of voting data. The component is wrapped in a styled `VoteTableSection` component for style purposes.

2. `VotesTableRow` - A styled component utilizing CSS Grid layout to define the headers of the vote table. 

3. `RowHeading` - A styled component representing the table header sections utilizing the 'Inter' Font. 

4. `VoteTableSection` - It is a styled component which provides styling to the 'VotesTable' by setting margins, height and overflow properties. 

The table is designed to be scrollable and styles are applied with the Styled-Components library.
