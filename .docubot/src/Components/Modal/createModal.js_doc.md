Title: Create Modal JavaScript Documentation

File Location: `/app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/Components/modal/createModal.js`

Description:

This JavaScript file contains a `createModal` function, which sets up a basic HTML structure for a modal or popup dialog to be used in the application. The function, when called, returns a string containing the HTML and CSS code for a styled modal div.

Code Breakdown:

- The CSS code establishes basic styles for the modal. The modal initially is invisible (`display: none`) and positioned to take up the entire viewport. The modal will appear on top of all other content (`z-index: 1`) and is centered with a slight (`padding-top: 30px`). The modal's background-color is semi-transparent black (`background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.4)`), which will overlay on the content beneath it when the modal is displayed.

- The HTML code creates a div with an ID of `myModal` and a class of `modal`. The content of the modal is to be inserted into `myModal`.

- The file exports the `createModal` function using `module.exports`. This makes the function available to be imported and used in other JavaScript files in the project. Note that all content within the modal is removed except for the div with ID `myModal`, which would serve as the container for a React component or other dynamic content to be injected into at runtime.
