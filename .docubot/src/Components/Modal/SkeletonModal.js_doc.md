The JavaScript file `SkeletonModal.js` features a functional component that displays a grid layout skeleton UI (User Interface) while the actual content is being loaded. 

The component uses React and Styled-components library for customized style elements. The skeleton UI is developed using Material UI's Skeleton component, which allows for the animation of several UI components, such as text lines, rectangular and rounded boxes. 

The structure of the layout includes a two-column grid-accommodating text lines and rectangular sections on the leftmost column, and a set of rounded skeleton boxes (representing buttons) positioned on two opposite corners. Additional textual lines of varying lengths are kept in the mid-section for data representation. 

The skeleton boxes are designed with an animation effect called 'wave' that helps to give users a sense of progressing load operation.

The SkeletonModal component is responsible for displaying this layout during data-fetching or processing times to maintain a smooth user flow.
