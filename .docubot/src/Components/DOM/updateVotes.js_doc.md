This is a JavaScript (JS) file named "updateVotes.js". The primary function, `updateVotes`, is an asynchronous function that works on updating votes status through various elements, including pull requests and mergeable code from users and contributors. It uses objects, conditional checks, and state management using `setState()`. Here's a summary of its functionality:

- The script starts with defining function `updateVotes`. It takes arguments such as `PR_user`, `PR_repo`, `PR_issueID`, `PR_contributerID`, `PR_side`, `PR_status`, and `voteButton_textMath`.
- The function uses functions like `postGetPullRequest`, `postGetPRvoteYesTotals`, `postGetPRvoteNoTotals` and `mathUtil.votePercentToMergeInteger` to update the state of the votes.
- The status of a pull request (PR) is checked before proceeding. If it is null or undefined, the function will update the PR status with the current status.
- Depending on the status of the PR (pre-open, open, close, or merge), the function updates the PR status. There are respective checks for each status and depending on whether these conditions meet, the status gets updated.
- The function includes conditional rendering, changing the display modal property based on PR status. 
- The function also handles the possibilities of GitHub PR status codes, including whether a PR is mergeable, has conflicts, or has a permanent status (closed or merged). Depending on these conditions, the respective vote button's color and text are updated using React's `setState()`.
- Exception handling is used to prevent the script from breaking when any error occurs during the entire process. It sets `textMath` to an empty string in case of any exception. 

In short, the script manages the process of voting in the context of Github PRs, handling all associated statuses and possibilities.
