**File Description:** 
This JavaScript file defines a custom React component named 'VoteStatusButton'. The component is used to handle user votes for pull requests in a Git repository. The component uses state variables and React's built-in hooks to manage and track user interaction and response.

**Key Functions/Components:**

1. **useState**: The State Hook provided by React to add in-state functionality in functional components. It is used here for managing multiple state variables.

2. **useEffect**: The Effect Hook used to perform side effects in function components, used in fetchVoteStatus and setting the vote status button color and text.

3. **fetchVoteStatus**: This asynchronous function retrieves the pull request and voting data from a remote source using POST requests. The state variables are updated based on the values returned.

4. **handleClick**: This function prevents the default action of a click event and calls a toggleModal function passed as props from a parent component.

5. **Button**: A styled button is returned in the component that displays the vote status. The button color and displayed text change dynamically based on the state.

**Dependencies:**

1. React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

2. ReactDOM: Provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app.

3. react-bootstrap: Bootstrap components for React.

4. custom requests: Imported server request functions to fetch PR and voting data.
