This JavaScript script implements a React component, `FuncTurboSrcButtonOpen` that represents a Button element in a user interface. This Component is utilized to display and manage the states of pull request votes. It primarily interacts with voting and PR status.

Key features:

1. The default state of the button is gray with a '?' sign. The state is updated according to the status of the pull request and voting results.

2. It handles click events with a function called `handleClick()`. The function prevents the default action upon clicking, but can be expanded to include other logic if needed.

3. It uses React's `useEffect` to make asynchronous HTTP requests to retrieve the total votes (both affirmative and negative) for a particular pull request.

4. It uses utility functions from the `mathUtil` and `postGetPRvoteYesTotals` and `postGetPRvoteNoTotals` functions from `requests` module to handle voting calculations.

5. The Component uses several bits of state to handle user details, repository details, voting totals, and the state of the button itself.

6. The color and text of the button get updated based on the server's response status and state (pre-open, open, closed, merged, vote, conflict). The text also displays the calculated voting percentage.

7. Props passed to this component:
   - `user`: GitHub user
   - `repo`: The repository
   - `issueID`: The issue ID associated with the PR
   - `contributorName`: The name of the contributor
   - `contributorID`: The ID of the contributor
   - `tsrcPRstatus`: The status of the PR; used for state changes of the button
   - `side`: Not actively used in this file but can serve a potential future requirement
   - `clicked`: A prop used to activate the useEffect hook which updates the button's status according to the most recent vote counts and PR status. 

8. Importantly, this component has a dependency on Bootstrap for the Button component and their styling.

Note: Dependencies include `React`, `react-dom`, `react-bootstrap`, and several custom modules (like `requests`, `commonUtil`, `mathUtil`).
