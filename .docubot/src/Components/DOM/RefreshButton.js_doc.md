# RefreshButton.js File Documentation

`/app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/Components/DOM/RefreshButton.js` is a JavaScript file that manages the `RefreshButton` component in a Chrome extension.

## Dependencies
- `react-draggable`: It's used to add drag-and-drop functionality to the refresh button.
- `styled-components`: It's used for component styling.
- `@mui/icons-material and react`: It's used for using icon components.

## Components
### Icon
The `Icon` component is a styled component that represents the Refresh button. It has several style properties like background color, border radius, cursor handling, and drop-shadow filter.

### rotateElementOnClickForHalfSecondWithTransition
This function rotates the refresh icon element on click for half a second.

### RefreshButton
The `RefreshButton` component is a draggable icon. On click, it invokes the passed-in `props.refresh` function as well as the `rotateElementOnClickForHalfSecondWithTransition` function, providing a visual feedback to the user by rotating the icon on refresh.

In conclusion, the file provides the draggable refresh button implementation for the application that triggers a refresh action and animates the button with a 360-degree rotation upon clicking.
