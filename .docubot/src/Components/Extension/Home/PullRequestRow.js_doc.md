This is a JavaScript file for an application's feature related to handling Pull Requests (PRs) on the UI, possibly within a development context. The file appears to be a part of the front-end layer of the application designed with React and styled-components library. Here's a brief information of its parts:

1. **PullRequestRow Function**: This is a React component to render a PR's representation on the front-end. This component receives various properties related to the PR, including its index, issue_id, state, forkBranch, title, and the corresponding 'yes' and 'no' percentages.

2. **State Management**: The file employs React Hooks (useState, useEffect) for managing states. It calculates the percentages of 'yes' and 'no' votes concerning the PR and makes sure they add up to 100%.

3. **Styled Components**: These are components styled with the styled-components library assisting in responsible design and enhancing UX. For instance, the `RowPR` styled component is a grid displaying PR information, including status, title, and voting percentages. It also changes its background color on hover.

4. **Percentages Display**: `GreenText` and `RedText` display the percentages of 'yes' and 'no' votes, respectively.

5. **Issue ID Display**: `Index` displays the issue id associated with the PR.

6. **Issue Title Display**: The `TitleOverflow` ensures the PR title fits into the designated space without disturbing the UI and without necessitating unnecessary scrolling.

7. **Status Badge**: The `StatusBadge` is a component that likely shows the PR's current state. 

The ultimate purpose of this file is to allow the user to understand important information about a PR at a glance and possibly make decisions regarding the reviewed code.
