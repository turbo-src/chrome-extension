File: `/app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/Components/Extension/Auth.js`

**Overview**:

This file contains the 'Auth' component of a Chrome extension that is developed using React.js. The purpose of this component is to handle and display the Login Component for the extension.

**Detail**:

- Importing React and Link from 'react-router-dom' indicates that this extension uses the React Router library for managing routing and navigation.
- The component also imports a 'Login' component, suggesting that this Authentication component is mainly dealing with the login features.
- The component exports a single default function 'Auth' which returns JSX code.
- The JSX returned by the function appears to consist of a parent 'div' with two child 'div' elements. The inner 'div' contains a 'form' tag that renders the 'Login' component.
- The use of the 'form' tag implies that the 'Login' component likely contains some form fields, and their data is intended for authentication.
