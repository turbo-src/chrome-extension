File: `Success.js`

This JavaScript file is a functional React component named `Success`. It receives props `amount`,`currency` and `repo`, and displays a success message after tokenizing a repository. This component also has a state `complete` which it initializes to `false` using the `useState` React Hook.

### Key Elements:

1. **Home component:** If the `complete` state is true, this component renders the `Home` component passing `repo` and `currency` as properties. 

2. **Success Message Section:** If the `complete` state is false, this component renders a section which displays the `amount` and `currency`, an icon to signify success, and a message indicating the repository name (`repo`) has been tokenized successfully. 

3. **Continue Button:** There's also a button which, when clicked, changes the `complete` state to `true`, causing the component to re-render the `Home` component.

This component is part of the Create Extension in a chrome-extension application, likely related to tokenizing repositories in some form of crypto-currency wallet. The file's location suggests it is intended to represent the final step of a successful operation.
