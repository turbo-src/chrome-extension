This script is a React component part of a Chrome Extension that displays a styled voting table for single pull request views.

Key Features:
1. The file sets up a styled component for VoteTableSection which is a div with an overflow scrollbar and a fixed height. This creates a definite section for displaying vote data on screen.
2. It has another styled-component, VotesTableRow, which displays grid system for laying out data in rows with four columns, but this component is currently not displayed (display: none).
3. RowHeading: Sets the style for the table's heading which includes an imported font.
4. The default exported function, VotesTable accepts a prop, "allVotes", that is an array of vote objects.
5. It uses a map function to create a list of Row components to be rendered within the VoteTableSection. This row component is imported from './Row.js'.
6. Each Row component is passed with props id, votepower ,side, age, key and index which are used to populate the data of each individual vote.

React Hooks used: None

Data Flow:
- allVotes array is passed into the VotesTable component.
- Within the function, this array is mapped to an individual Row component for each vote.
- Within each Row component, the individual vote data (id, votePower, side, createdAt) is displayed.
