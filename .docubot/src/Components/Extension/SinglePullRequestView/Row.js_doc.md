Based on your summary the Row.js file seems to be a React component script for a single row instance within a Pull Request View related to a Google Chrome Extension. 

The script includes the following functionalities:
- `getDurationSince()` function takes a timestamp and calculates how long has passed since then, outputting the duration in a fitting unit (seconds, minutes, hours or days). It returns this duration as a React component with styled span tags.
- Styling for the various elements in the row, such as the unit of time duration, the overall grid layout and properties of different text elements. The colors used for styling are conditionally determined based on whether the vote was in favour of (green) or against (red).
- `makeAllCaps()` and `addCommas()` functions to manipulate text and numerical values respectively.
- The component, `Row()`, takes properties for id, votepower, side, age and an optional index. It uses these properties to display a row with id of the pull request, voting power, cumulatively computed side (it could be 'yes' or 'no'), and how long ago the voting period ended.
- Utilizes React hooks (`useState() and useEffect()`) to manipulate and manage component state and side-effects. This includes a ticker that updates every second which triggers an update in the component. 

In summary, this file is responsible for displaying details about individual votes in a more readable, formatted manner inside a Chrome extension.
