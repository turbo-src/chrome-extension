# SinglePullRequestViewSkeleton.js

This JavaScript file defines a skeleton screen for a single pull request view in the application, which is typically displayed while the data is being loaded.

### File Details

Imported Libraries:
- React: to create and manage the component's UI.
- styled-components: to write CSS in JavaScript, enabling easier component styling by using flexbox for layout, and setting relative positioning and margin parameters.
- @mui/material/Skeleton: component from Material-UI library to create a skeleton screen, which is a version of the screen that contains no actual information, essentially a placeholder for the content that gets displayed when the real data finishes loading.

Component Structure:

The `SinglePullRequestViewSkeleton` function component renders a skeleton view of a `PullRequest`. The component includes:
- A flex container `SkeletonFlex` with centrally aligned items.
- Two `Skeleton` components that simulate text with a wave animation. These might correspond to pull request title and description.
- A `ButtonSpan` component that holds another `Skeleton` component that simulates a rectangular button. This could correspond to the interactive elements of a pull request such as 'Merge', 'Close' buttons.

The skeleton components come in different sizes suggesting different elements of the pull request information. The wave animation can make the loading state more visually engaging. The purpose of this skeleton view is to maintain a better user experience during data fetching by providing a placeholder until the actual content is ready to be rendered.

### Styling:

Styling is achieved using the styled-components library which allows us to write actual CSS.

- `SkeletonFlex` is a div styled to display its contents in a centered column.
- `ButtonSpan` and `SmallTextSpan` are span elements styled with different top margins.
