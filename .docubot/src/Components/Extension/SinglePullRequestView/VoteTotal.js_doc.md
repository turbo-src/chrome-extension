The file `VoteTotal.js` is a React component styled with the library styled-components. It handles the view of individual pull request votes in a Chrome extension related to the 'app-filebot-store-000'. Here is the breakdown of the file content:

1. **Styled-components**: The file defines multiple styled components using the styled-components library, including Heading, VoteText, OwnerText, PullRequestTitle, MediumText, VoteTopicText, VoteTopicNormalText, TopModalTitle, and OwnerRepo. All these components have their unique CSS.

2. **addCommas function**: Apart from the CSS styling, the file includes an 'addCommas' function that receives a number as an argument, processes it, and returns a string with commas added after every third digit counting from the right side of the number. It uses standard JavaScript functions such as 'toString', 'split', 'splice', and 'join' to achieve this.

3. **VoteTotal component**: Finally, a functional React component named 'VoteTotal' is defined. This component receives 'repo', 'title', 'baseBranch', 'forkBranch', and 'votePower' as props and returns a JSX template. VoteTotal uses previously defined styled-components to construct this template. The template depicts an individual view of a pull request vote where 'votePower' is formatted by the 'addCommas' function. 

The VoteTotal component is exported for use by other components in the application.
