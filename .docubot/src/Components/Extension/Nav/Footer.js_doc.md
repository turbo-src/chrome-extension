File: /app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/Components/Extension/Nav/Footer.js

This JavaScript file defines a 'Footer' component using React. The function component is exported as a module to be used by other components or modules when needed. 

The Footer component creates a div containing a clickable text "turbo-src support". The words "Get help:" lead into a hyperlink labeled "turbo-src support" which does not lead anywhere as the href is deliberately left empty("#"). 

This file can usually be found in the navigation part of a page and is intended to provide users a link to access support if needed. However, the actual URL of the support page would need to be added to enable this functionality.
