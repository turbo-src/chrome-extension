# Documentation for Loader.js in chrome extension, /app/filebot-store-000

## Overview
Loader.js is a JavaScript file which leverages the React library to define the Loader component used in the Chrome extension. This component provides a visual indicator to users that an operation is currently executing and that they should wait for its completion.

## Structure
The component's functionality is encapsulated in a single function (a functional component), namely, `Loader()`.

## Functional Component

### Loader()

This function, `Loader()`, defines an inline JSX component that returns a div element containing another div for the loader section, and three "span" elements within it.

1. **Verifying...**: The first span element displays the text "Verifying..." on the user interface. This indicates that some process is underway, letting the user know the application is working on their request.

2. **Loader GIF**: The second span element uses an image tag to display a loader gif (loading animation), highlighting visually that a process is running. If the image cannot be located or loaded, the alternative text "loading..." is displayed.

3. **Message**: The third span element provides an additional message that assures the user that the process will only take a short while, displaying: "This will just take a second".

The path to the loader gif image file is imported at the start of the script.

## Styling
The CSS classes applied to div and span elements ("content", "section", "bigText", "items-center", "loader") are not defined within this file. Presumably, these are defined elsewhere in the application's stylesheets, and their specific styles and behaviors would depend on those definitions.
