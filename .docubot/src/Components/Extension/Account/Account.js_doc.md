This file contains the code for the Account module of a Chrome extension developed using React and redux. 

The primary function of the file is to display the user profile information and associated settings. This includes the user's name, username, avatar, Ethereum address, and Ethereum Key. 

Key Features:

1. **Select and Display User Information**: The module uses the `useSelector` hook to fetch the state of the user and the repository from the redux store to display the user's information.

2. **Notify of Clipboard Events**: It provides functions to copy the Ethereum address and key with a subsequent toast notification.

3. **Styled Components**: The UI aspect of the Account module is crafted using `styled-components`. These components have their styles declared in this file itself. 

4. **Settings Component**: The Setting components are integrated within the Account component.

5. **Fetch Token Amount**: On component rendering, a `useEffect` Hook calls a `getTokenAmount` function which uses the `postGetVotePowerAmount` request to fetch the number of tokens the user has.

6. **Hidden and Visible Signature**: Users can toggle the visibility of their Ethereum key using AiOutlineEyeInvisible and AiOutlineEye icons from `react-icons`.

7. **Redirect to User URL**: The username displays as a hyperlink, redirecting to the value of `user?.html_url` on clicking.

This component is a part of the src/Components/Extension directory signifying its role in a Chrome Extension.
