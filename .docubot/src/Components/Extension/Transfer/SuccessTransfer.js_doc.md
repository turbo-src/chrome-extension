**File Name:** SuccessTransfer.js

**Location:** `/app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/Components/Extension/Transfer/`

**Function:**
This Javascript file, using React, styled-components and react-router-dom libraries, defines the component 'SuccessTransfer' which displays a success message after the completion of a file/data transfer. It includes elements such as headers, image for success message, a transferring receipt and buttons to navigate to home or make another transfer. 

**Main Components:**

- `Content`, `Header`, `Receipt`, `TransferSummary`, `Table`, `BottomWrapper`, `TransferButton`, `HomeButton` are constant styled-components used to shape the design properties and layout structure of the SuccessTransfer component.
- `SuccessTransfer` is a function component that takes props related to the file/data transfer and renders the success message page. It makes use of the `navigate` hook from `react-router-dom` to provide navigation options to the user after the successful transfer.

**Functions:**

- `timeConverter` function to convert UNIX timestamp to a human-readable date format.
- In `clickHandler` function, an event `e` is taken and prevented default action, then sets a default case for a transfer object and navigates the user based on the button clicked ('Home' or 'Transfer' which allows to make another transfer).

**Note:**

Any changes made in this file will directly impact the success transfer message page of the application.
