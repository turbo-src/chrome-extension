`Review.js` is a React component that displays a summary of a pending token transfer for review before submission in a Chrome extension. 

Highlighted Features:
- Displays transfer details including the repository, sender (logged-in user), recipient, amount of tokens, and network info.
- Contains a dynamic "ContinueButton" which triggers the transfer when clicked on (using the `clickHandler` function) and "Back" button to return to the previous step.
- Utilizes `useSelector` hook from `react-redux` to retrieve details about the currently user.
- Uses `postTransferTokens` function from '../../../requests' to process the token transfer when the submit button is clicked.  
- Triggers two possible outcomes upon submission: 
   1. If successful (HTTP status code 201), it updates certain properties in the `transfer` object and advances to `SuccessTransfer` after a delay.
   2. If not successful, sets an error text indicating a failure in transfer processing.
- Styles are implemented using styled-components module. 

Key CSS Components:
- Content: Main styled layout for the component view.
- Header: Styled layout for the header.
- TransferSummary & Table: Styled layouts for the summary of the transfer.
- Continue and ContinueButton: Styled layout and element respectively, that manage the processing of the "submit" of reviewed details.
- ErrorText: Styled layout for potential error messages during processing.

Note: All components are styled using the `styled-components` library. The CSS properties are self explanatory for each styled component.
