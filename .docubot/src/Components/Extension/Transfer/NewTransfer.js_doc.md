File: NewTransfer.js

Description:

This is a React component file for managing the creation of a new "Transfer of VotePower" in a chrome extension application. It provides a form for users to input recipient name and vote amount for the transfer operation. It interacts with a backend through /requests to fetch and post data.

Key Functionalities:
1. Fetches the amount of VotePower for a user asynchronously from the server.
2. Checks and validates user input for recipient name and Vote Power amount.
3. Submits transfer information to be reviewed.
4. Displays loading, error, and validation messages dynamically.
5. Uses styled components for structure and styling.

Components:
- NewTransfer: This is the main functional component. It uses React's useState and useEffect for state management and side effects.
- Content, Header, Form, Repository, Recipient, ErrorText, Amount, Continue, ContinueButton: These are styled-components for the structured representation of the form and other layout sections. They specify styles and responsive behavior.

Dependencies:
- React
- Styled-components
- loader.gif
- postGetContributorID and postGetVotePowerAmount from '../../../requests'   

Note: This JS file assumes the presence of an API endpoint to handle vote power transfers and ID retrieval. It uses both POST requests and requires the user's Ethereum address. If these particular endpoints or setup does not exist in your API, you may need to configure it accordingly.
