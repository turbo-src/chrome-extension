**Documentation for /app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/store/store.js**

The `store.js` file is an integral part of the Redux architecture of this Chrome Extension. It is responsible for creating and exporting a Redux store, which becomes the single source of truth for the state of this application.

Key functions and objects:
- `createStore`: A Redux function used to generate a new Redux store.
- `rootReducer`: A combined reducer that is received from an external `reducer.js` file. This reducer is responsible for defining how the state of the application changes in response to actions sent to the store.
- `store`: This is the single, centralized location where your application's state lives. It is generated by invoking `createStore` with `rootReducer`.

The default export of this file is `store`, which can then be imported and utilized by other files within the application. This `store` allows for managing and updating the state of the application by dispatching actions and subscribing to changes.
