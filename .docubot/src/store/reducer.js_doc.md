**File Name:** reducer.js

**Location:** /app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/store/

**Description:**

This JavaScript file is primarily responsible for combining multiple reducers in Redux Store for the Chrome extension application. It defines a default 'rootReducer' which includes 'authReducer' and 'repoReducer'.

**Key Components:**

1. **authReducer** - Import from './auth'. This reducer is designed for handling changes in authentication states such as logging in and logging out.
 
2. **repoReducer** - Import from './repo'. This reducer is responsible for managing state changes related to repositories.

3. **rootReducer** - The main reducer function that holds the state object. The function takes in two arguments:
   - The 'state' argument, which is the previous state before the action is updated. It is initialized with an empty object.
   - The 'action' argument, which is dispatched to trigger the state change.

The rootReducer returns a new state object with updated 'auth' and 'repo' substates, which are derived by invoking respective reducers ('authReducer' and 'repoReducer') with the relevant parts of the previous state and the action payload.
