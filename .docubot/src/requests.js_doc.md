This JavaScript file, "requests.js", is part of a Chrome extension and seems to be managing various HTTP requests to an API. It makes use of the 'superagent' library to simplify handling of these HTTP requests.

Some of the key functionalities available from this file include:

1. Communication with a GraphQL API: Most of the functions deal with sending POST requests to an API endpoint with GraphQL queries. The responses are parsed for specific data.

2. Configuration management: The file references a config file for the URL of the API endpoint and includes checks for different environments such as local development or different deployment environments.

3. User and repo management: Functions are available to create new users, fetch users by their ID or name, check token permissions, and create GitHub repositories.

4. Pull Request and Repo manipulations: You can create, merge, or get the status of pull requests. Similarly, it includes functions to get or set votes on pull requests, transfer tokens, get repo status and more.

5. Error handling: Some of the functions include basic error handling, primarily logging the errors if they occur.

6. Contributor details: Functions are available for getting authorized contributor and their details.

7. Forking
