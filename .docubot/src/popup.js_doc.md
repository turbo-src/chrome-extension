File: /app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/popup.js

This JavaScript file is used by a Chrome extension that interacts with GitHub. When run, it gains the active tab and splits the URL into its component parts to retrieve the 'user' and 'repo'. It then sends these details to GitHub API endpoint to fetch repository data.

Key Functions:
- `chrome.tabs.query`: Queries the Chrome browser to return details about the current active tab in the last focused window.
- `fetch`: Sends a GET request to the GitHub API to obtain details about a specific repository owned by a specified user.

If the requested repository is not found, it sets dummy values for owner and repository name. After obtaining the repository information, it uses ReactDOM to render a React app (imported from 'App.js') within a dom container with id 'rootcontainer', passing the repository information as a prop.

Dependencies:
- React: A JavaScript Library for building user interfaces.
- ReactDOM: The DOM-specific methods for React.
- App.js: A Javascript module representing a React application.
=======
**File Location:** /app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/popup.js

This file is a part of the chrome extension, and it utilizes React and ReactDOM libraries for creating and rendering the UI, and additionally uses the App component from './App.js'.

**Key Components:**
1. **Imports and Initialization:** This file utilizes require statements to import necessary modules (`React`, `ReactDOM`, and `./App`). Initializes `cypress` and tries to set it to the contents of `cypress.env.json`, otherwise leaves it as an empty object.

2. **EventListener:** A 'DOMContentLoaded' event listener is used to execute a function once the HTML document is fully loaded. The function finds the dom container '#rootcontainer' to render the application.

3. **URL Check and Data Fetch:** There's a check for the current window location. If it is not "http://localhost:5001", the extension will try to fetch repository data using the URL of the current active tab. If it is the localhost URL, the extension will fetch repository data based on the `cypress` config. If no repo is found in both cases (a 'Not Found' message is returned from GitHub API), dummy data `{ owner: { login: 'none' }, name: 'none' }` will be set.

4. **Rendering:** Finally, it leverages the ReactDOM module to render the App component into the targeted dom container, passing as prop the currently queried repository data.
