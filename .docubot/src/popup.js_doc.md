**File Location:** /app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/popup.js

This file is a part of the chrome extension, and it utilizes React and ReactDOM libraries for creating and rendering the UI, and additionally uses the App component from './App.js'.

**Key Components:**
1. **Imports and Initialization:** This file utilizes require statements to import necessary modules (`React`, `ReactDOM`, and `./App`). Initializes `cypress` and tries to set it to the contents of `cypress.env.json`, otherwise leaves it as an empty object.

2. **EventListener:** A 'DOMContentLoaded' event listener is used to execute a function once the HTML document is fully loaded. The function finds the dom container '#rootcontainer' to render the application.

3. **URL Check and Data Fetch:** There's a check for the current window location. If it is not "http://localhost:5001", the extension will try to fetch repository data using the URL of the current active tab. If it is the localhost URL, the extension will fetch repository data based on the `cypress` config. If no repo is found in both cases (a 'Not Found' message is returned from GitHub API), dummy data `{ owner: { login: 'none' }, name: 'none' }` will be set.

4. **Rendering:** Finally, it leverages the ReactDOM module to render the App component into the targeted dom container, passing as prop the currently queried repository data.
