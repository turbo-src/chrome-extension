**File Name**: App.js

**Location**: /app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/

**Overview**: This file is the main entry point for a React application that uses Redux for state management.

**Specifics**: 

1. **React and React-Redux**: The file uses React for building the user interface and React-Redux for managing the application state. 

2. **Provider**: It wraps the entire application in a Redux Provider, allowing the contained Routes component and all its child components to access the Redux store.

3. **Toaster**: The Toaster component from 'React-hot-toast' library is used for providing notifications to the user. 

4. **Routes**: Imported from './Routes'. This is likely where the app's routing logic resides. This component gets the 'currentRepo' property passed down from the App component.

5. **Store**: The Redux store manages the state information of the application and it is imported from './store/store'. 

This file seems ideal to look into if you are wondering how the application bootstraps, handles routes and manages state.

**File:** /app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/App.js

**Summary:**

This is the main application file for the Chrome Extension built using React and 'react-redux'. It establishes the Provider for the React-Redux store, sets up routing for the application with 'Routes', and includes a Toaster for notifications. 

**Key Elements:**

1. **React**: A JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.

2. **./style.css**: The stylesheet for this App component.

3. **Routes.js**: This file is imported from './Routes' and is used to handle routing within the application.

4. **Redux Store**: This is imported from './store/store' and is the central location where the application's state is housed.

5. **Provider from react-redux**: A wrapper component from 'react-redux' that makes the Redux store available to the rest of your app.

6. **Toaster from react-hot-toast**: A component from 'react-hot-toast' package that is used to notify users about the status of certain processes.

**Function Description:**
The exported default function 'App' takes 'props' as an input argument which comes from the parent component. The prop 'currentRepo' is passed down to the 'Routes' component. The function returns a tree of React components, where '<Provider>' injects the Redux Store into React components, '<Routes>' manages the routing, and '<Toaster>' handles showing toasts for user notifications.
