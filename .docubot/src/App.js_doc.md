**File Name**: App.js

**Location**: /app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/src/

**Overview**: This file is the main entry point for a React application that uses Redux for state management.

**Specifics**: 

1. **React and React-Redux**: The file uses React for building the user interface and React-Redux for managing the application state. 

2. **Provider**: It wraps the entire application in a Redux Provider, allowing the contained Routes component and all its child components to access the Redux store.

3. **Toaster**: The Toaster component from 'React-hot-toast' library is used for providing notifications to the user. 

4. **Routes**: Imported from './Routes'. This is likely where the app's routing logic resides. This component gets the 'currentRepo' property passed down from the App component.

5. **Store**: The Redux store manages the state information of the application and it is imported from './store/store'. 

This file seems ideal to look into if you are wondering how the application bootstraps, handles routes and manages state.
