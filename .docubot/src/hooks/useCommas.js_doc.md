**Description:** 

The `useCommas.js` file exports a function named `useCommas`. 

**Function: useCommas(tokens)** 

This function takes integer `tokens` as input.

Its primary functionality is to convert integer values into string representations where numerical groups are comma-separated for the sake of enhanced readability, especially for numbers with five or more digits. 

The conversion processes are as follows: 

- If `tokens` equals 0 or less than 1000, the function returns the `tokens` without any modification.

- For `tokens` values equal to 1,000,000, the function returns a string '1,000,000'. 

- For `tokens` equal to or more than 100,000, the function splits the integer into two parts - the first consisting of the leading three digits, and the second containing the remaining digits. These digit groups are then rejoined into a single string with a comma separator.

- For values of `tokens` in the range 10,000 to 99,999, the function separates the leading two digits from the remaining digits with a comma.

- For values of `tokens` between 1,000 and 9,999, the function separates the leading digit from the remaining digits with a comma.
