File: /app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/config.devOnline.json

Summary:
This JSON configuration file is responsible for holding the configuration settings of the chrome extension, specifically when it's in its development version and using an online environment. 

The key parameter "url" suggests the root URL of the service the extension communicates with during its operation. In this case, it is "https://turbosrc-marialis.dev". This might be the address of an API or other back-end service required for the proper functioning of the extension. 

Modifying this file could redirect the extension interactions to another development or testing site. Always ensure to use the correct URL to not disturb the chrome extension functioning.
