This is a Webpack configuration file for a chrome extension project. It defines the entry point for the application, provides the rules for handling different types of files, specifies output details and contains a sequence of Webpack plugins used to enhance the build process. The file also includes a function to dynamically add plugins based on the build mode.

Key parts of the module:

1. **Entry:** Indicates where Webpack should start building the project. In this case, there are two entry points, `src/popup.js` and `src/inject.js`.
  
2. **Output:** Specifies where to emit the compiled bundles. Output files will be placed in a `dist` directory and named based on their entry configuration (`[name].bundle.js`).

3. **Rules:** Series of loaders are defined here. `babel-loader` is used to transpile JavaScript files using Babel and webpack, `css-loader` interprets `@import` and `url()` like import/require() causing them to be resolved by webpack and `style-loader` adds CSS to the DOM by injecting a `<style>` tag.

4. **Plugins:** A variety of plugins are used such as Dotenv for using environment variables, CleanWebpackPlugin to clean the build directory, CopyPlugin to copy individual files or entire directories to the build directory and ZipFilesPlugin to zip the files when built in production mode. A function `addPlugins(argv)` dynamically adds plugins depending on the mode of build.

5. **WatchOptions:** Configuration for webpack's watcher feature which triggers a rebuild as soon as some code has changed. 

6. **Dependencies:** It lists all package dependencies from `package.json` file and display them in the banner comment header.
