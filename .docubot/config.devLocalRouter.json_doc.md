Title: **Configuration File for Local Development Router**

**File Location:** /app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/config.devLocalRouter.json

**File Summary:** 
This is a JSON configuration file for the Chrome extension's local development router. It's associated specifically with the `filebot-store-000` application in your project's directory.

**Primary Contents:** 

- `url`: This key is associated with the local URL of your GraphQL server, which is typically used for testing functionalities during development without interacting with the live server. Set by default to `http://localhost:4006/graphql`.

- `turboSrcID`: This key is set as an empty string `""`. It's likely a placeholder for a source ID, possibly for a tool or service like TurboSource.

**Usage:** 

Modify this file to adjust the parameters as per your local development requirements. For instance, if your local server's address changes, you'd update the `url` parameter; similarly, if you have a relevant source identifier, you'd update `turboSrcID`.

Remember, this is your local development configuration file; it shouldn't impact your production build unless explicitly used. Always consider your specific project structure and development needs when editing this file.
