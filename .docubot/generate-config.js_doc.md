File: `/app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/generate-config.js`

This JavaScript file is used to generate a configuration file (`config.js`) for the chrome extension based on the current environment (specified by the environment variable `TSRC_EXT_NODE_ENV`). 

If the `TSRC_EXT_NODE_ENV` variable isn't set, it defaults to 'devLocal'. The `config.js` file is created within the `src` directory under the current working directory.

This file utilizes modules such as `fs` and `path` from Node.js. It reads the original configuration from a JSON file that corresponds to the current environment (for example, `config.devLocal.json`), converts it to a string, formats it into JavaScript, and writes it into `config.js`.

The final `config.js` file looks like this:

```javascript
const CONFIG = <stringified config>;
...
module.exports = CONFIG;
```

Finally, it logs to console the turbo source build mode, the path of the config file, and the contents of the created `config.js` file. The console logs help in verifying the current configuration of the build by showing the details of the used configuration file and its contents.
