Summary: 

This Javascript file is responsible for server-side functionalities of the Chrome Extension web application. The server runs on Node.js with Express.js as the web framework. It employs 'body-parser' for parsing incoming request bodies in a middleware before handlers.

Key Features:

1. CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing mechanism is employed here. It allows many resources (e.g., fonts, JavaScript, etc.) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated.

2. OAuth Authentication: The server interacts with Github's OAuth API to authenticate users. It exchanges a code obtained from the client-side for an access token from Github, and then retrieves user's profile data using this access token.

3. Static Server: The server can serve static files, with the '/authenticated' route serving files from a '/src/authenticated' directory.

4. Error Handling: For handling errors, there are 'catch' methods in Promises which return an HTTP 400 Status Code (for bad requests) along with the error object.

5. Port Configuration: The server listens on the port defined in the environment variables or port 5000 by default.

Note: The file uses 'dotenv' package to load environment variables, which include Github Client ID, Github Client Secret, Github Redirect URI and server port.

Dependencies: express, body-parser, node-fetch, path, form-data, dotenv.
