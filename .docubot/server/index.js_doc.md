**File Description**: 
This is a server-side JavaScript file for a Chrome Extension application. It uses Express.js, a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js, to create a server.

**Noteworthy Features:**

1. Requires libraries including express, body-parser, node-fetch, path, form-data, and dotenv.

2. Initializes an instance of express and sets it to the variable app.

3. Uses body-parser middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in a middleware before the handlers. 

4. Incorporates body-parser to parse JSON and URL-encoded data as well as text types.

5. Implements the use of CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) headers to address potential CORS errors. 

6. Serves static files from a directory named 'dist' that is located one level up from the current directory.

7. The application is set to listen on port defined in the environment variables (process.env.SERVER_PORT) or defaults to 5001 if the environment variable is not set.

8. When the server is up and running, it logs a message stating the port it's listening on.
