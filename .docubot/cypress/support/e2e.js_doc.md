**Title**: End-To-End Testing Support File

**Location**: /app/filebot-store-000/chrome-extension/cypress/support

**File**: e2e.js

**Description**: 

This JS file, named e2e.js, is part of the Cypress framework and it is used for end-to-end (E2E) testing. It is automatically processed and loaded before other test files to provide global configurations and behaviors that modify Cypress.

Key Features:
1. Global Configuration: It's a great place to put global configuration for your tests.
2. Modifiers: It allows behavior modifications that directly affect Cypress.
3. Syntax Compatibility: This file supports ES2015 syntax for importing other JS files (like commands.js). Alternatively, CommonJS syntax can also be used.
4. Customizability: Location of this file, or whether it's served automatically, can be changed with the 'supportFile' configuration option.

Further information and guidance on how to customize this configuration can be found in the official Cypress documentation at https://on.cypress.io/configuration.
