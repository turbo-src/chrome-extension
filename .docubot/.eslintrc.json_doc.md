This JSON configuration file sets the rules for ESLint, a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. 

Here are the main parts of this file:

- `extends`: Contains the configuration presets that this package extends from. It's using two presets `standard` and `plugin:prettier/recommended`, which would be ensuring a basic level of code quality and enforcing prettier code formatting respectively.
  
- `rules`: It contains specific linting rules for the code. Two rules are mentioned: `promise/param-names` which is turned off, and `handle-callback-err` which is set to 0, indicating it won't enforce any style on handling callback errors.
  
- `env`: Specifies the environments the JavaScript code is designed to run in. This setup is suitable for code meant to run in the browser, web browser extensions, Node.js, and Jest (a JavaScript testing framework).
